Pi Projects
==========

An unofficial open source raspberry pi projects android app.  It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

I decided to make this app open source because I might not have time to work on it.  Soon I will create a todo list of things I am aware of that need done.

As commits are made, I will periodically make builds to publish.

Todo List:
* Add a license to this open source project
* Find author of /src/com/rigney/raspberrypiprojects/AutoResizeTextView.java and give credit
* Add commenting system (I will do myself)
* Clean up code
* Fix some UI bugs
* Add more features
* Fix NullPointerException crash. TODO: Still need to add stack trace.
* Implement limitation on posts so only XX can be listed at once.  This will require a "Previous XX" or "Next XX" probably in the action bar. The Web API already implements part of this using IDs.  I'll have to finish Web API implementation.
* Add offline reading capabilities
* More coming
