Pi Projects
==========

An unofficial open source raspberry pi projects android app.  It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

I decided to make this app open source because I might not have time to work on it.  Soon I will create a todo list of things I am aware of that need done.

As commits are made, I will periodically make builds to publish.
